               <p>I came up with JONNESMATT due to so many comlpications I had in web development, use and application of several web languages.</p>
               <p>Learners who are currently and those who wish to enroll to wed development, I encourage you that it's easy no matter you're not a genious; it all matters on your creativity and mode of reasoning. I heheby welcome you all to web development as its all of fun and you'll enjoy.</p>
               <p>To my fellow comrades who have the passion in developing I welcome you all to programming. It's quite of fun and interesting. Also, interaction with developers all round the globe it's easy.</p>
               <p>Fellow comrades, I won't tell you that web development is easy for sometimes I got stuck. This didn't diminish my goal for my passion and interest was deep rooted as I loved to be like other wed designers. "PATIENCE AND COMMITMENT" was my driving motto, for at times I usually used comlicated codes without knowing how  to apply them thus crushing my source code.</p>
               <p>Am now currently on another level aiming higher to become an expert as this is my area of specialization.</p>
